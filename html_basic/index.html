  <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
  <p>Hello! My name is Farhan, and this is my very first web portfolio. I'm excited to showcase my journey as I learn web development and build creative digital projects.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I have a background in engineering and recently transitioned into IT. I’m passionate about solving problems, learning new technologies, and building tools that can help people.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
  <p>This project is part of my web development training. It includes basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and structured content.</p>

  <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
  <p>As I continue learning, I’ll be adding more projects to this portfolio — including styled pages with CSS and interactive content using JavaScript.</p>
